This is code for a simulation of mutation load in a population over time, 
focusing on the possible effects of accumulating small-effect deleterious mutations.

The model is currently an individual-based model with a fixed population size with linked birth and death events. 
Parents are chosen randomly for each death and fitness affects probability of being chosen as a parent.
